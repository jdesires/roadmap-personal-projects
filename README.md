# roadmap/personal projects
python projects on roadmap.sh and some of my own small projects.

Going to be a mix of simple projects and hopefully some larger projects, while I get slowly get better at understanding python. 
Eventually will get into some data driven projects because I aspire to be a DE.

Currently trying to understand and get better at OOP.
